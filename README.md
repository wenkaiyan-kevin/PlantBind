# PlantBind: An attention-based multi-label neural networks for predicting transcription factor binding sites in plants
###   Introduction
Identify of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are essential for the analysis of gene regulation. Here, we present PlantBind, a method for the integrated prediction and interpretation of TFBS events from DNA sequences and DNA shape profiles. Built upon an attention-based multi-label deep learning framework, PlantBind not only simultaneously predicts the binding sites of 315 TFs.  
As shown in Figure 1. The hybrid model consists of data processing module, embedding module, feature extraction module, and multi-label output module.
